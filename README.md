# Introduction

These are applications that I'm developing during my doctorate program.

# Requirements:

I'm using the following third party libraries in my code:

- assimp (Open Asset Import Library): http://assimp.sourceforge.net/lib_html/index.html
- FreeImage: http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/
- GLEW: http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- FreeGLUT: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
- AntTweakBar: http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/

I have uploaded a preloaded setup environment that let's you compile the code with ease. Download this zip file:

Extract at root directoy of this repository (code/.) and you should ready to compile the programs.
